Can you prescribe me something?","With what I see, I think you have a skin rash on your arm, possibly eczema or dermatitis, given the redness and patchy appearance of the skin. I would suggest some topical corticosteroid creams to reduce inflammation and itching, and also recommend keeping the affected area moisturized with a gentle lotion, if the condition persists, we may need to consider further examination and possible oral medication.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Voice TTS\769ee3952ab686d0c20e\final.mp3,2025-07-10 11:47:27.275525
